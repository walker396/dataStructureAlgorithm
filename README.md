## Time Complexity
- Constant Time: O(1)
  1. The algorithm always takes the same amount of time to execute, regardless of the input size.
- Logarithmic Time: O(log n)
  1. The algorithm's running time grows logarithmically in proportion to the input size.
- Linear Time: O(n)
    1. The algorithm's running time increases linearly with the size of the input.
- Linearithmic Time: O(n log n)
    1. The algorithm's running time is a product of linear and logarithmic growth.
- Quadratic Time: O(n^2)
    1. The algorithm's running time grows quadratically with the size of the input.
- Cubic Time: O(n^3)
    1. The algorithm's running time grows cubically with the size of the input.
- Exponential Time: O(2^n)
    1. The algorithm's running time doubles with each addition to the input data set.
- Factorial Time: O(n!)
    1. The algorithm's running time grows factorially with the size of the input.
